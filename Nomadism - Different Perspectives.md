### Nomadism: Different Perspectives

I would like to bring nomadism back to digital nomadism.

My life story:
  Identification:
    - Don't identify with where I was born
    - Don't identify with where I live
      - Today in Portoguese class, I said "Eu sou de Novo Ingleterra", instead of "Eu sou de Boston".
    - Having nothing left for me where I grew up

  - Never lived anywhere longer than 2 years
  Academic Nomadism
    - University in Scotland
    - University in Germany, in Malta
  Hobopunk nomad
    - Hitched 20,000 miles: US, Japan, Europe
  Sailor nomad:
    - Lived on sailboats; both as crew and as the owner
  Hipster nomad
    - 1 year per place: New York, San Francisco, Boston
    - List of most expensive cities in the states
  What's next?

Currently: Digital, semi-grounded nomad

"Digital nomads are people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and, more generally, conduct their life in a nomadic manner." - Wikipedia
